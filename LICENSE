Ripple is a pure event-driven high concurrency/async SOCKETS framework for PHP based on the subscribe/publish model.

It differs from traditional MVC frameworks and is characterized by its adoption of the asynchronous I/O model,
which effectively improves the concurrent processing ability and response speed of the system.

Ripple decouples each module by event,
making the system more flexible and extensible.

Although Ripple is not a traditional MVC framework,
it can be used as a supporting dependency for MVC architectures to provide better support for developers.

Ripple provides MVC components such as routes, request handlers, controllers, views, etc.,
enabling developers to quickly build an MVC application based on the Ripple framework.

Ripple can be used both as a standalone framework and as a supporting dependency for MVC applications.

Thank you for your attention and support of Ripple. We will continue to improve and optimize Ripple.
