PRipple is a pure event-driven high concurrency/async SOCKETS framework for PHP based on the subscribe/publish model.It differs from traditional MVC frameworks and is characterized by its adoption of the asynchronous I/O model,which effectively improves the concurrent processing ability and response speed of the system.PRipple decouples each module by event, making the system more flexible and extensible.Although PRipple is not a traditional MVC framework,it can be used as a supporting dependency for MVC architectures to provide better support for developers.PRipple provides MVC components such as routes, request handlers, controllers, views, etc.,enabling developers to quickly build an MVC application based on the PRipple framework.PRipple can be used both as a standalone framework and as a supporting dependency for MVC applications.Thank you for your attention and support of PRipple. We will continue to improve and optimize PRipple.Please feel free to contact the author, cclilshy, at jingnigg@gmail.com,if you would like to learn more about PRipple or get involved in its development and maintenance.MIT LICENSECopyright (c) 2023 cclilshyPermission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining a copy of this software and associateddocumentation files (the "Software"), to deal in the Software without restriction, including without limitationthe rights to use, copy, modify, merge, publish, distribute, sublicense, and/or sell copies of the Software, andto permit persons to whom the Software is furnished to do so, subject to the following conditions:The above copyright notice and this permission notice shall be included in all copies or substantial portions of the Software.THE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED "AS IS", WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TOTHE WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NON INFRINGEMENT.
